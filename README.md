Basic Template for Angular 2
============================


This template includes a very basic squeleton to prepare for Angular 2 projects. It is configured to
save the compilation results (*.js,*.map) in the './out' directory. (check tsconfig.json). 

To initialize the project with the node modules use:

`
npm install --prefix ./out/node_modules
`

and then..

`
npm start
`
